## [HERO HOOK]

**The people running the company just bought the stock. Are you paying attention?**

Corporate executives see the real numbers before anyone else. When they quietly put their own money on the line—not stock options, not bonuses, *their own cash*—it means something.

We track those moves. You get the trade ideas. No paywall, no subscription.

## What "Insider Trading" Actually Means

Most people hear "insider trading" and picture handcuffs and perp walks. That's the illegal kind—trading on secrets and hiding it from the market.

There's another kind that's completely legal and completely public.

When CFOs, COOs, and Directors buy shares in their own companies, they're required to disclose it within days through regulatory filings (Form 4, SEC EDGAR). These filings are public record. Anyone can see them.

The problem? There are thousands of filings. Most are noise. The signal is buried.

That's where we come in.

## Why Following Insiders Works

Insiders sell for dozens of reasons—taxes, divorce, a new house, diversification. But they usually buy for one reason: they believe the stock is undervalued relative to what they know is coming.

The academic research backs this up:

- **25.8% annualized returns** from portfolios built on US Form 4 insider buys (1976–1996), compared to 15.6% for the market—an extra 10% per year before costs.
- **4.8% outperformance** over the following year for strategies tracking heavy insider buying versus heavy selling, adjusted for risk.
- **6–8% annual excess returns** (risk-adjusted) from open-market insider purchases across decades of US data.

This isn't a theory. It's been studied, published, and replicated.

## What We've Done With It

We took the academic edge and built a system around it.

Our screening process focuses on the highest-conviction signals:

- **Cluster buying** — Multiple senior officers buying within tight windows. One exec buying is a data point. Three buying in the same week is a signal.
- **Meaningful size** — Large dollar allocations that insiders can't "sleepwalk" into. We're talking real money, not token purchases.
- **Role weighting** — Extra emphasis on CFOs, COOs, and key VPs—the people who live in the numbers.

The result? A rules-based, repeatable methodology that's produced:

- Stock-only years exceeding **140% portfolio returns**
- Individual moves of **40–75% within two months** of disclosure
- Edge that held through volatile macro regimes

The point isn't one lucky trade. It's that cluster + conviction + timing has delivered across multiple years.

## Why It's Free (And Still Serious)

Most insider-signal services hide behind expensive paywalls or bundle the ideas with other products you don't need.

We keep it free so you can focus on what matters: implementation, risk management, and fit with your own style—not subscription overhead.

In return, we ask one thing: treat these ideas like a professional tool, not a lottery ticket. Use proper sizing. Set stops. Understand the typical two-month swing-trade horizon.
