## [HERO HOOK]

**The people running the company just bought the stock. Are you paying attention?**

Corporate executives see the real numbers before anyone else. When they quietly put their own money on the line—not stock options, not bonuses, *their own cash*—it means something.

We track those moves. You get the trade ideas. No paywall, no subscription.

## What "Insider Trading" Actually Means

Most people hear "insider trading" and picture handcuffs and perp walks. That's the illegal kind—trading on secrets and hiding it from the market.

There's another kind that's completely legal and completely public.

When CFOs, COOs, and Directors buy shares in their own companies, they're required to disclose it within days through regulatory filings (Form 4, SEC EDGAR). These filings are public record. Anyone can see them.

The problem? There are thousands of filings. Most are noise. The signal is buried.

That's where we come in.

## Why Following Insiders Works

Insiders sell for dozens of reasons—taxes, divorce, a new house, diversification. But they usually buy for one reason: they believe the stock is undervalued relative to what they know is coming.

The academic research backs this up:

- **25.8% annualized returns** from portfolios built on US Form 4 insider buys (1976–1996), compared to 15.6% for the market—an extra 10% per year before costs.
- **4.8% outperformance** over the following year for strategies tracking heavy insider buying versus heavy selling, adjusted for risk.
- **6–8% annual excess returns** (risk-adjusted) from open-market insider purchases across decades of US data.

This isn't a theory. It's been studied, published, and replicated.

## What We've Done With It

We took the academic edge and built a system around it.

Our screening process focuses on the highest-conviction signals:

- **Cluster buying** — Multiple senior officers buying within tight windows. One exec buying is a data point. Three buying in the same week is a signal.
- **Meaningful size** — Large dollar allocations that insiders can't "sleepwalk" into. We're talking real money, not token purchases.
- **Role weighting** — Extra emphasis on CFOs, COOs, and key VPs—the people who live in the numbers.

The result? A rules-based, repeatable methodology that's produced:

- Stock-only years exceeding **140% portfolio returns**
- Individual moves of **40–75% within two months** of disclosure
- Edge that held through volatile macro regimes

The point isn't one lucky trade. It's that cluster + conviction + timing has delivered across multiple years.

## Why It's Free (And Still Serious)

Most insider-signal services hide behind expensive paywalls or bundle the ideas with other products you don't need.

We keep it free so you can focus on what matters: implementation, risk management, and fit with your own style—not subscription overhead.

In return, we ask one thing: treat these ideas like a professional tool, not a lottery ticket. Use proper sizing. Set stops. Understand the typical two-month swing-trade horizon.

## Why I'm able to give you my trade ideas for free

The only reason this can exist as a free service is because of AI.

Example:
So if you were streaming Form 4s and looking only at US “P” (purchase) codes, you’re realistically dealing with a few dozen buy filings per day, before any extra filters (size, cluster, role, etc.).

Putting this into something actionable:

Raw stream: ~45–50k US insider trades/year. You’d never want to act on all of them.

After sensible filters (e.g. buys only, officers/directors, clustered purchases, meaningful size vs salary, excluding 10b5-1 plans), many academic-style strategies end up with dozens to a few hundred “actionable” trades per year, depending on how tight you make the filters. (That number isn’t given explicitly in one paper; it’s inferred from typical sample sizes and filters used across studies.)

Thank you to AI for making this filtering possible. After I've run my proprietery AI models ( which I developed maintain & improve over time), I do my due diligence manually then I'm left with 5-10 trades per year that I'm willing to put my own capital to work on.

What used to require a team of full-time analysts can now be done with a lean, automated research stack. As a trader myself, I need this data and these insider setups for my own decision-making anyway. Sharing the same ideas publicly doesn’t cost me anything extra – it just means more eyes and better discussion around the best setups.

So you’re not “getting charity.” You’re getting access to the same research I already use to manage my own capital.




## Why I Can Give You My Trade Ideas for Free

The only reason this service exists at no cost is because of AI.

Here's the reality: if you're monitoring Form 4 filings and looking only at US "P" (purchase) codes, you're dealing with around 45,000-50,000 insider trades per year. Obviously, you'd never want to act on all of them.

**The filtering process breaks down like this:**

After applying sensible filters-buys only, officers and directors, clustered purchases, meaningful size relative to salary, and excluding automated 10b5-1 plans you're left with dozens to a few hundred potentially actionable trades per year, depending on how strict your criteria are.

That's where AI changes everything. What used to require a team of full-time analysts can now be handled by a lean, automated AI research stack. I've developed and continue to maintain proprietary AI models that do the heavy lifting on this initial filtering.

**Then comes my part:** After the AI does its work, I manually review each opportunity with proper due diligence. That final step leaves me with a couple of trades per week that I'm confident enough to risk my own capital on.

**Here's the key point:** As a trader, I need this data and these insider setups for my own decision-making anyway. I'm already doing this research to manage my own portfolio. Sharing the same ideas publicly doesn't cost me anything extra, it just means more eyes and better discussion around the best setups.

So you're not getting charity. You're getting access to the exact same research I use to trade my own money.

## Why I Care Who Joins

Working with **like-minded investors and traders** is one of the biggest edges you can have, but only if you're actually trading ideas, not looking for someone to push buttons for you.

Even though the ideas are free, I'm still vetting who gets access. I'm specifically looking for:

1. **Active investors or traders with adequate capital**  
   You don't need to be running a fund, but you should be able to actually size positions when a high-conviction idea appears.

2. **People who want a long-term relationship, not a one-off hit**  
   The edge here comes from cycles of ideas → execution → feedback → refinement. If you're just looking for the next "lottery ticket," this isn't for you.

3. **Independent decision-makers who own their risk**  
   This is **not** a signal service. I'm sharing what I'm watching and how I'm thinking about it. You decide what to trade, how to size it, and where your stops go. Your P&L is your responsibility – both the wins and the losses.

If that sounds fair, you're exactly the type of person I want working with me.

If you don't quite fit that profile but still think you'd add value to the discussion, feel free to explain why in the form. Just keep it real – no spam.
