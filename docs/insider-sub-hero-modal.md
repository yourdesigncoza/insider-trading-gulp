## Why Insider "Cluster Buying" Changes Everything

Insiders sell for a hundred reasons—taxes, tuition, divorce, diversification. But they buy for one:

**They believe the price is going up.**

Now add this: What if the CFO, COO, AND General Counsel all buy within the same week?

That's **clustered buying**—the market's strongest conviction signal:

- Multiple informed insiders agree the stock is undervalued
- They're risking their own money, not just talking on CNBC
- They're moving before the news breaks

We ignore the noise and zero in on these clusters.

## The Executives We Watch Closely

Not all insiders are created equal. Some are much closer to the truth than others.

### 🧮 Chief Financial Officer (CFO) – The Numbers Don't Lie

The CFO lives in cash flow, debt ratios, margins, and forecasts.

- Often a stronger signal than the CEO (less political pressure to "show confidence")
- Deeply aware of what the business is really worth
- When they buy: *"I've seen the books. This is cheap."*

### ⚙️ COO & Senior Vice Presidents – Running the Machine

These are the people operating the business day to day.

- They see problems and opportunities in real-time, before analysts do
- When they buy alongside the CFO, conviction multiplies

### ⚖️ General Counsel – The Reluctant Gambler

Lawyers are wired to avoid risk.

- Highly conservative, deeply aware of legal and regulatory landmines
- When the company's own lawyer is buying stock with personal money, they really believe the upside is worth it

### 👥 Directors – The Consensus Check

Directors might only meet quarterly, but:

- They're usually experienced, well-connected, and well-informed
- Multiple directors buying together adds serious weight to the signal

## What We Ignore vs. What We Hunt

Not every insider purchase matters. We filter ruthlessly.

### ❌ What We Ignore:
- CEO photo-op purchases for PR
- Automatic monthly 401(k) contributions
- Token $10K buys from board members
- Routine option exercises

### ✅ What We Hunt:
- **Multiple key executives** (CFO, COO, VPs, General Counsel, Directors)
- **Meaningful dollar amounts** (real money on the line)
- **Purchases within days or weeks of each other** (the cluster)

That's where the highest-conviction swing trades tend to hide.
