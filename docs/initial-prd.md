### Source guide
This document outlines a sales strategy for a financial service focused on capitalising on corporate insider trading, specifically the disclosed purchases made by high-level executives like CFOs and VPs. The service offers a single, all-inclusive subscription at $100 per month, providing users with high-conviction trade ideas designed for opportunistic swing trades, averaging two months in duration. The core rationale is that insiders generally only buy shares when they believe the price will increase, and the system filters this data by prioritising cluster buying and large-dollar-value transactions to distinguish genuine signals from routine activity. Additionally, the service provides a separate managed account service for clients who require assistance with trade execution and management.

### Project Summary
The collected sources provide a comprehensive look at the practice of **insider trading** and the tracking of **politician stock trading** for investment purposes. Several videos explore the **legality and illegality** of insider trading, clarifying that non-public information used for profit is criminal, whereas legitimate insider transactions (such as CEOs buying company stock) must be publicly disclosed via **SEC filings**, which can serve as a positive investment signal. A major theme is the controversial outperformance of the market by members of the US Congress, leading to the creation of **ETFs and tracking tools** that monitor their public transaction reports, though concerns are raised about **reporting delays** and the lack of economic rationale behind some political trades. Finally, the sources discuss how **AI and advanced data analytics** are now being used both by regulatory bodies, like the SEC, to **uncover suspicious trading patterns** and by retail investors to automate the tracking and analysis of these various forms of insider activity.

### 🚀 **Unlocking the Inner Circle: Your Guide to High-Performance Trading**

#### 1) Very Catchy Intro: Follow the Corporate Smart Money 💡

**Tired of feeling left behind while the financial elite reap massive profits?** 💸 Imagine having access to the same market-moving insights as the most connected people on the planet: **CEOs, CFOs, Directors, and other C-suite executives**. These individuals, who are privy to information the public is not, often make trades that signal huge, explosive moves in stock prices.

Our system tracks the legal disclosures of these corporate heavyweights. We identify the moments when they are piling into a stock with their own money, often right before good news hits.

**Stop guessing and start following the smart money.** Our trade ideas are designed for **opportunistic swing trades, typically held for days to weeks, averaging two months** [Conversation History]. Your edge is here—join the elite corporate inner circle today!

#### 2) The Proven Power of Following Insiders 📈

Academic studies and real-world results show that tracking and acting on insider purchases can **significantly outperform the general market**.

💡 **Outperformance Metrics:**

*   One premium trade alert service, based solely on insider buying and selling activities, reported single-year returns as high as **292.9%** (not including option trades). The founder of this service states definitively that this methodology is one of the best ways to outperform the market and find explosive stocks.
*   High inside ownership in a company also academically tends to outperform the general market because owners are incentivised to create long-term shareholder value.
*   In times of crisis and uncertainty, insiders demonstrate incredible timing. During the COVID selloff in March 2020, many insiders were buying right at the bottom of the market, demonstrating very great timing.
*   For example, one stock followed by insiders in late 2019/early 2020 ran up **300%** over the following months. Another example showed a stock gain **75% in a single month** after a cluster of insider buys were revealed.

#### 3) The Logic Behind High-Conviction Corporate Trades 🤔

The foundation of our strategy rests on a simple truth: **insiders know more than outsiders**.

"Insider trading" involves trading in company stock by the company's officers, directors, or influential shareholders (those owning more than 10% of the stock). These individuals are allowed to buy and sell shares of their own stock, provided they release this information in a timely manner via an SEC filing (Form 4).

While there are many reasons why an insider might **sell** shares—such as paying bills, buying a house, diversifying their holdings, or receiving shares as compensation—there is typically **only one reason why an insider will buy shares in their company:** they believe in the company and think the share value is going to go up over time.

By carefully monitoring this publicly available buying activity, focusing specifically on **Corporate Insiders** [Conversation History], we pinpoint opportunities based on:

*   **Cluster Buying:** When multiple insiders (two or more) buy stock around the same time, it sends a stronger signal and suggests a consensus that the company is undervalued or on the cusp of good news. More insiders buying indicates a greater chance the news is strong.
*   **Conviction and Size:** Insiders who are putting **significant money** into a purchase are showing conviction. For this service, we prioritize trades that are substantial in dollar value, as purchases of small amounts (like $3,000–$15,000) are often routine 401k contributions or automated buys and are **not considered opportunistic**.
*   **Targeting CFOs and VPs:** We often place **more weight on trades made by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)** and Vice Presidents than the CEO. CFOs are intimately connected to the company's financials, liabilities, and valuation, making their purchase a very strong signal of conviction.

#### 4) Subscription & Managed Service Details 💎

We offer a focused, streamlined solution to capitalize on these high-conviction trades:

*   **Single, All-Inclusive Subscription:** Access to all our research, alerts, and detailed trade plans is available through one, simple, all-inclusive subscription [Conversation History].
*   **Price:** The cost for this access is **$100 per month** [Conversation History].

##### Managed Account Service: Trading Made Simple

We also offer an exclusive service designed for clients who are **not savvy enough** to actively place and manage trades themselves [Conversation History].

*   **The Service:** We provide a service to **place and manage trades** for you using an "omni" group account [Conversation History].
*   **Why this is essential:** While trading based on structured data unlocks possibilities, automatically executing trades based on signals is considered *super risky* for the untrained individual. Our managed service allows you to benefit from the insider signals without having to manage the complexity and rapid execution required to capture quick gains.

#### 5) We Do the Heavy Lifting for You 💡

The process of finding truly actionable insider trades requires extensive research to filter the signals from the noise.

**We dedicate the time, perform the deep research, and deliver the highest conviction trade ideas directly to your inbox**. Our process involves sophisticated screening criteria and tools to analyze the mountain of SEC filing data:

*   🔍 **Scanning for Opportunities:** We scan for recent insider purchases, looking specifically for **cluster buying** (multiple corporate insiders buying) and transactions that meet a significant dollar threshold.
*   🧠 **Deep Analysis (The "Opportunistic" Filter):** We examine the trading history of each insider, checking their track record, position (favouring CFOs and VPs), and relationship to the company to ensure the trade is genuinely opportunistic and not a "show of faith" buy from a newly appointed executive or routine selling.
*   🛡️ **Filtering False Signals:** We diligently filter out non-informative transactions, such as:
    *   Small 401k-style buys.
    *   Option exercises, especially those where the stock is immediately sold (a derivative disposition).
    *   Fund activity (large institutional rebalancing, where a 10% owner is maintaining a portfolio weighting rather than acting on specific news).

You don't need to spend hours deciphering cryptic Form 4 filings or worrying about the legality of copying these disclosed trades.
