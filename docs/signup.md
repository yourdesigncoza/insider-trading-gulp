## Why I Can Give You My Trade Ideas for Free

The only reason this service exists at no cost is because of AI.

Here's the reality: if you're monitoring Form 4 filings and looking only at US "P" (purchase) codes, you're dealing with around 45,000-50,000 insider trades per year. Obviously, you'd never want to act on all of them.

**The filtering process breaks down like this:**

After applying sensible filters-buys only, officers and directors, clustered purchases, meaningful size relative to salary, and excluding automated 10b5-1 plans you're left with dozens to a few hundred potentially actionable trades per year, depending on how strict your criteria are.

That's where AI changes everything. What used to require a team of full-time analysts can now be handled by a lean, automated AI research stack. I've developed and continue to maintain proprietary AI models that do the heavy lifting on this initial filtering.

**Then comes my part:** After the AI does its work, I manually review each opportunity with proper due diligence. That final step leaves me with a couple of trades per week that I'm confident enough to risk my own capital on.

**Here's the key point:** As a trader, I need this data and these insider setups for my own decision-making anyway. I'm already doing this research to manage my own portfolio. Sharing the same ideas publicly doesn't cost me anything extra, it just means more eyes and better discussion around the best setups.

So you're not getting charity. You're getting access to the exact same research I use to trade my own money.

## Why I Care Who Joins

Working with **like-minded investors and traders** is one of the biggest edges you can have, but only if you're actually trading ideas, not looking for someone to push buttons for you.

Even though the ideas are free, I'm still vetting who gets access. I'm specifically looking for:

1. **Active investors or traders with adequate capital**  
   You don't need to be running a fund, but you should be able to actually size positions when a high-conviction idea appears.

2. **People who want a long-term relationship, not a one-off hit**  
   The edge here comes from cycles of ideas → execution → feedback → refinement. If you're just looking for the next "lottery ticket," this isn't for you.

3. **Independent decision-makers who own their risk**  
   This is **not** a signal service. I'm sharing what I'm watching and how I'm thinking about it. You decide what to trade, how to size it, and where your stops go. Your P&L is your responsibility – both the wins and the losses.

If that sounds fair, you're exactly the type of person I want working with me.

If you don't quite fit that profile but still think you'd add value to the discussion, feel free to explain why in the form. Just keep it real – no spam.
