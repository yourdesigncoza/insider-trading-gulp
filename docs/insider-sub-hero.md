## Follow the Corporate Smart Money

When a company's CFO, COO, and General Counsel all start buying stock with their own money at the same time, they're not guessing. They know something the market doesn't—yet.

Most investors are drowning in data. We do something radically simpler:

👉 **We follow the people who actually know what's going on inside the business.**

When multiple senior executives quietly buy their own stock around the same time, they're acting on a level of understanding the public won't see for months.

That's our edge. That's where we hunt for opportunities.

### A Real Example

In March 2024, three executives at a mid-cap tech company bought over $1.8M in stock within 11 days. The stock was trading at $52.
